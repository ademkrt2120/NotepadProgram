#** Notepad Program (NotKasasÄ±)**

=> I developed a note-taking program for my project.

=> This work was an important step in my self-improvement process.

=> In this second project, I had the opportunity to advance my skills further.

=> Users enter the program in a standard way and are presented with a main page form.

=> On the main page, users select the action they want to perform and are directed to the corresponding form.

=> The main page displays the last 2 notes, 2 list items, and reminders created.

=> In the note creation form, users personalize their notes by selecting color, size, and font.

=> The created note is then saved to the database.

=> Similarly, in the list and reminder forms, users can create items in a simpler manner with the same logic.

EXPLANATION

=> Users should first register and log in, and if the information is incorrect, the program will check it and display a message screen to the user.
Then, the main page form will open. In this main page form, users can see the last 2 notes, 2 list items, and reminders they created.
The main page form also contains a live clock and calendar, which users can see while performing actions.
On the left side of the main page form, there are buttons to redirect users to other forms. These buttons will take the user to the form they want to interact with.
In the note creation form, users can create a note, update it, delete it, and clear the contents of the boxes in the program at any time. Users can customize their notes as they wish. 
I added 3 customization options (color, size, and font).
List creation and reminder forms work on the same logic but are simpler. Users can add, delete, and update list items or reminders as they wish.
